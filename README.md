# socialMobility
Senior math capstone project using Markov chains and machine learning to better understand social mobility in the United States.


Work is largely based off of the paper [*Where is the land of Opportunity? The Geography of Intergenerational Mobility in the United States*](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/129/4/1553/1853754) by Raj Chetty et al.

Data is pulled from the [Opportunity Insights website](https://opportunityinsights.org/data/). Specifically, tables 6 and 8 from the *Geography of Mobility: National 100 by 100 Transition Matrix* excel sheet.
